# Azure Cost vs Sales

This repository, **Azure-Cost-vs-Sales**, provides a comprehensive analysis of Azure cloud costs in relation to sales data. The primary goal is to help organizations understand the relationship between their cloud expenditures and revenue, enabling data-driven decisions for cost optimization and maximizing return on investment (ROI).

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Import Azure billing/export data and sales reports.
- **Data Processing**: Clean, transform, and join cost and sales data.
- **Visualization**: Generate interactive charts and dashboards to compare costs vs. sales over time, by product, region, or customer segment.
- **Reporting**: Export summary reports for stakeholders.
- **Customization**: Adapt analysis to specific business needs or additional data sources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ (or specify relevant version)
- [Azure SDK for Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/)
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, (and other required libraries)

You can install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Preparation

1. **Azure Cost Data**: Export your Azure billing data (CSV/JSON format) from the Azure Portal or Cost Management APIs.
2. **Sales Data**: Prepare your sales reports in CSV or Excel format.

Place your data files in the appropriate `data/` directory or update config as needed.

### Usage

Run the main analysis script:

```bash
python analyze_cost_vs_sales.py --cost-data data/azure_costs.csv --sales-data data/sales.csv
```

This will process the data and generate comparative reports and visualizations in the `output/` directory.

### Configuration

Configuration options (such as file paths, grouping parameters, output preferences) can be set in the `config.yaml` file.
